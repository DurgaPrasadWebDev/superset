# Superset Frontend Overview

## Architecture
- Built using React for building user interfaces.
- Utilizes Redux for state management, ensuring a predictable state container for the application.

## Key Directories
- **`src`**: Contains the application's core logic, components, and styles.
- **`components`**: Reusable UI components used across the application.
- **`explore`**: Logic for the Explore view, where users create and modify visualizations.
- **`dashboard`**: Manages dashboard functionality for creating and viewing dashboards.
- **`utils`**: Utility functions used throughout the application.

## State Management
- **Redux**: Manages global state with actions, reducers, and selectors.
- **Reducers**: Specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.

## Data Flow
- **Actions**: Dispatched to trigger state changes, containing a type and payload.
- **Selectors**: Extract specific pieces of state for use in components.

## Styling and Theming
- **Global Styles**: Managed in `GlobalStyles.tsx` for a consistent look and feel.
- **Theme Support**: Customizes the application's appearance.

## Build and Configuration
- **Webpack**: Bundles the application, optimizing performance and managing dependencies.
- **Babel**: Transpiles modern JavaScript and TypeScript code for browser compatibility.

## Detailed Explanation of `datasourcesReducer.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages the state of data sources within the Explore view.
- **Imports**: Includes `Dataset`, `getDatasourceUid`, and actions related to data sources.
- **Reducer Logic**:
  - **Initial State**: Object mapping unique identifiers to datasets.
  - **SET_DATASOURCE Action**: Updates state by adding or updating a data source.
  - **HYDRATE_EXPLORE Action**: Replaces current state with data sources from the action payload.
  - **Default Case**: Returns existing state if no relevant action is dispatched.
